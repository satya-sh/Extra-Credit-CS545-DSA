Problem 1: Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
    Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

    A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

    Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Problem 2: How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
    Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

    Return the answer in an array.
