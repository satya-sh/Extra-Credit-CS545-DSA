Problem 1: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
    Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

    A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along
    the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Problem 2: Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers
    You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1.
    Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

Problem 3: Minimum Number Game
    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length and there
    is also an empty array arr. Alice and Bob decided to play a game where
    in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules of the game are as follows:

    Every round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from nums,
    and then Bob does the same.
    Now, first Bob will append the removed element in the array arr,
    and then Alice does the same.
    The game continues until nums becomes empty.
    Return the resulting array arr.
