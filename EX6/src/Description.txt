Problem 2: Root Equals Sum of Children
    You are given the root of a binary tree that consists of exactly 3 nodes: the root,
    its left child, and its right child.

    Return true if the value of the root is equal to the sum of the values of its two children,
    or false otherwise.

Problem 2: Search in a Binary Search Tree
    You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

    Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node.
    If such a node does not exist, return null.
