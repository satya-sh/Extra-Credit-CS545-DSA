Problem 2: Jewels and Stones
    You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels,
    and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type
    of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

    Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Problem 3: Same Tree
    Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if
    they are the same or not.

    and the nodes have the same value.
